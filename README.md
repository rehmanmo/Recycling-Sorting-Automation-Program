# Recycling Sorting Automation Program

This is a project where we built a recycling sorting automation program using Python. The program takes images of recyclable materials as input and classifies them into different categories, such as paper, plastic, and metal, using machine learning algorithms.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project were to:

- Build a recycling sorting automation program using Python
- Improve the efficiency and accuracy of recycling sorting process
- Raise awareness of recycling and sustainable practices

## Usage

To use the recycling sorting automation program, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries and dependencies (list them in a separate `requirements.txt` file if possible).
2. Launch the program using a Python interpreter or an IDE, such as Jupyter Notebook.
3. Input an image of a recyclable material using the program's GUI or command line interface.
4. Wait for the program to classify the material into a category.
5. Repeat for other recyclable materials.

## Features

The recycling sorting automation program has the following features:

- GUI or command line interface for inputting images
- Different categories for recyclable materials, such as paper, plastic, and metal
- Option to add more categories or train the program on new materials
- Logging and reporting of classification results

## Future Work

In the future, we plan to:

- Improve the accuracy and efficiency of the machine learning algorithms
- Add more categories and materials to the program's classification system
- Integrate the program with real-life recycling sorting systems
- Develop a mobile application for the program
- Collaborate with local recycling facilities to test and improve the program's effectiveness

## Conclusion

This recycling sorting automation program is an example of how technology can be used to improve sustainability and promote recycling practices. By automating the recycling sorting process, we can reduce waste, save time and resources, and make a positive impact on the environment.
